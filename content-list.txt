Python Overpass API - Python wrapper for the OpenStreetMap Overpass API (overpy?)

The Overpass API (formerly known as OSM Server Side Scripting, or OSM3S before 2011) is a read-only API that serves up custom selected parts of the OSM map data. It acts as a database over the web: the client sends a query to the API and gets back the data set that corresponds to the query.

Unlike the main API, which is optimized for editing, Overpass API is optimized for data consumers that need a few elements within a glimpse or up to roughly 10 million elements in some minutes, both selected by search criteria like e.g. location, type of objects, tag properties, proximity, or combinations of them. It acts as a database backend for various services.
osmapi - a python class to communicate with OpenStreetMap API v0.6 
osmcha - OSM Changeset Analyser, osmcha, is a Python package to detect suspicious OSM changesets. 
It was designed to be used with osmcha-django, but also can be used standalone or in other projects.
Nominatim API +geopy
OSMPythonTools -python package OSMPythonTools provides easy access to OpenStreetMap related services, 
among them an Overpass endpoint, Nominatim, and the OSM API.
OSMnx - Python package to easily download, model, analyze, and visualize street networks and 
other geospatial features from OpenStreetMap.
Pyrosm - Python library for reading OpenStreetMap from Protocolbuffer Binary Format -files (*.osm.pbf) 
into Geopandas GeoDataFrames. 
the main difference between pyrosm and OSMnx is that OSMnx reads the data using an OverPass API, 
whereas pyrosm reads the data from local OSM data dumps that are downloaded from the PBF data providers (Geofabrik, BBBike). 
This makes it possible to parse OSM data faster and make it more feasible to extract data covering large regions.
